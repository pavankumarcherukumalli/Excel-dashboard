# Excel-dashboard
I’m thrilled to showcase my latest Excel project: ROAD ACCIDENT DATA ANALYSIS!
In this project, I built a "Responsive Dashboard" to analyze road accident trends from 2021-2022. The goal was to provide key insights into casualties, accident severity, vehicle types, and road conditions to help in better decision-making.

Accidents are unfortunate, but "data-driven insights" can help us understand patterns and take preventive measures. In this project, I worked on real-world accident data (2021-2022) to build a Road Accident Dashboard that provides key insights into casualties, vehicle types, accident severity, and road conditions.

Project Overview:
✅ Data Source: Kaggle
 --> Steps Involved:
 📌 Data Collection
 📌 Data Cleaning
 📌 Data Analysis
 📌 Data Visualization
 📌 Report Creation & Key Insights

 Key Insights from the Dashboard:
🔹 Total Casualties & Severity: Analyzed how accident severity impacts total casualties.
 🔹 Vehicle-Type Analysis: Found the vehicle type responsible for maximum casualties.
 🔹 Monthly Trends: Compared casualties year-over-year to identify high-risk months.
 🔹 Road Type & Surface Analysis: Explored how road types and surfaces influence accidents.
 🔹 Time & Location Impact: Investigated whether day/night & area type affect accident rates.

 Skills Gained:
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Handling missing values, formatting data)
 ✅ Data Analysis (Identifying patterns & trends)
 ✅ Data Visualization (Creating dashboards for clear insights)
 ✅ KPI Development (Defining & measuring key performance indicators)
 ✅ Report Creation & Presentation

This project helped me strengthen my skills in data analysis and visualization. Excited to work on more real-world problems and gain deeper insights!
